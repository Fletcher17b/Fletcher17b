# Welcome to my Github homepage

Greetings vistor! My name is MG, an aspiring software engineer passionate about technology and it's applications. I'm the owner of this github page and of the repositories within it. Feel free to look around and try out my repos, as of now there aren't many but with time more should come.  

For future employers, here I have displayed some examples of my work deemed noteworthy enough to use as a showcase of my abilities, a sneakpeak of what I'm capable of. While I , as much as anyone else in this field of work , still have a long and exciting road of learning I hope that what you see here is sufficient to serve your needs.
